The simplest of Solution this was becuause all i needed was the formula in which only odd numbers were added up.

{
    ( Odd Number + 1 = ? / 2 = ? math.pow //which means squared// = The Awnser )
}

because of this all i needed to do was put it in a function and refine it untill it was the shortest amount of code i could get while still keeping the results the same and with all this i was able to complete this solution

I find myself using these equations alot in my code becuase they are simplistic and interesting to work with, i love the way there are more and more ways of using different commands that can make my code line shorter.
